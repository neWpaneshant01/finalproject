					I was born in May 17, 1995 in Butwal,Nepal. Talking about my academic background I have completed my schooling from "Shree Shiddhi Childrens Academy" in the year 2012. Then I joined CCT College of Technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Nepal, I had opportunity to work with different organization related to IT filed, i got motivated through them. There are so many 
					young entepuner who has inventes latest technological stuffs in Nepal, like, online shopping and social networking sites but theie work
					itself is limited. They couldn't or let say haven't promoted their work internationally. They have technological knowledge but lack 
					marketing skills. So, while being inAustralia I have ambition to learn technological things as well as skills to survive in this competing 
					world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here I am now studying in Australia living my dreams and studying hard to achieve my ambition.
