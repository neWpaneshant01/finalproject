		<h2> Introduction </h2>		
				 <p>
					I was born in March 26, 1997 in Kathmandu, Nepal as I am permanent
   resident of Kathmandu  Metropolitan City Ward No.5, Handigaun.I am the son of Hiraman Prajapat and Shreemai Prajapati.
  My dad is a bus driver and my mom is housekeeper. I would like to introduce myself as a genunie,
  hardworking, disciplined and competitive and a
   keen learner. Talking about my academic background I have completed my schooling from "The
   Insight Vision Secondary High School" in the year 2014. Then i did my intermediate from the 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_School_of_Sciences,_Lainchour" target="_blank">
   National School of Sciences </a> in science faculty. My major subject included physics, computer
   science and mathematics. After completition of my intermediate result i was free and was 
   searching for my next options for the futher studies.Then I got to know about Australia and 
   Australian Universities in some education fair. I found it quite convincing so I discussed with 
   my family and started preparing for IELTS classes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Nepal, I had opportunity to work with different organization related to It filed, i got motivated through them. There are so many 
					young entepuner who has inventes latest technological stuffs in Nepal, like, online shopping and social networking sites but theie work
					itself is limited. They couldn't or let say haven't promoted their work internationally. They have technological knowledge but lack 
					marketing skills. So, while being inAustralia I have ambition to learn technological things as well as skills to survive in this competing 
					world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here I am now studying in Australia living my dreams and studying hard to achieve my ambition.
